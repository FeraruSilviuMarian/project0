Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

*Description*
This is a fan-page for Life is strange video game, just a random subject off the top
of my head just to have something to do for the project.

It demonstrates a little bit of the power of bootstrap, sass, how to use at media events in
javascript and css.
The javascript file contains a tiny bit of code that changes a footer based on the window size.
"get it on steam" linking to steam, when the window is about the size of a computer,
"get it on adnroid"
"get it on ios" when the window is small enough for a phone or tablet.

Interesting how not using flask/jinja like in CS50, was difficult in the sense that I had to
copy paste a lot of sutff, instead of using a template and extending it.
