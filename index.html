            <h1>Life is Strange</h1>
            <p>Life is strange reolves around the character of Max, a teenage girl, a photography student
            that discovers she has time traveling abilities, this mechanism is interesting for the plot,
            and the gameplay, however, what impressed me personally is the emotions it evoked in me
            while playing this game. It's less about time traveling and more about human relationships,
            emotions, love, feelings, what makes us awesome as humans. It's also about choices and how
            they can change our lives.</p>
            <p>Life is strange: before the storm is the prequel of life is strange and it tells the story of
            Cloe, Max's best friend. For me personally this prequel was even more emotional than the previous
            game because Cloe is so relatable, she has no special powers, she falls in love
            she gets her heart broken, she struggles with family loss, and is forced into a new family dynamic.
            She empathizes with her mother but at the same time feels anger towards her life decissions and the
            relationship she's got into. In fact all of these are choices in the game, so you can steer how she
            feels about all of these things, making the character feel even more relatable.
            I loved Cloe so much that I have a wallpaper of her sitting on a train
            track ever since I played the game, in the actual game that scene plays out in an optimistic way, she
            sits in front of a train, but steps off just in time, this for me symbolizes so much. She wishes
            life was better, she wishes she was independent, but having her entire family togheder,
            she wishes her love life was
            fullfilling and not full of hearbreak, she's saddened about all of these, and thinks about
            the human condition, but at the same time she's optimistic about the future, she decides to live and
            that choice pays off, her life becomes better, taking the good with the bad, but still a life worth
            living.</p>
