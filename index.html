            <p>Development of <i>Life Is Strange</i> began in April 2013. It was formed with an episodic format in mind, for reasons both financial and creative. The developers conducted field research on the setting by travelling to the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Northwest" title="Pacific Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>, and subverted known <a href="/wiki/Archetype" title="Archetype">archetypes</a> to make the characters. Player feedback influenced the adjustments made to the episodes. Story and <a href="/wiki/Character_arc" title="Character arc">character arc</a> serve as the central point in the game.
